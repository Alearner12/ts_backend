#Backend Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my learning repository! This repository contains all the files, projects, and code examples from my journey learning backend development with modern technologies.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository documents my learning path through:

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for building robust applications
- **Prisma** - Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** - Powerful, open-source relational database
- **Serverless Architecture** - Building scalable cloud-native applications
- **Backend Development** - RESTful APIs, authentication, data modeling, and more

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- [ ] Master TypeScript fundamentals and advanced features
- [ ] Build type-safe backends with TypeScript
- [ ] Learn database design and management with PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement ORM patterns using Prisma
- [ ] Understand serverless architecture and deployment
- [ ] Create production-ready REST APIs
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Write clean, maintainable, and testable code

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

### Core Technologies
- **TypeScript** - Static typing for JavaScript
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime

## 🚦 Getting Started

As this is a learning repository, each project or example may have its own setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

```bash
# Install Node.js (v16 or higher)
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
